## Patient V 

The following project is a mathematical model that describes a hypothetical vaccination strategy called **Patient V**, whereby instead of having a traditional model of vaccination, we introduce an infected patient with a strain of virus that competes with the existing strain with a higher infection rate but a with a lower death rate. <br>

We would compare the outcomes of the two models and evaluate the costs associated with each strategy.
